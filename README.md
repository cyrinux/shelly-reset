# shelly-reset

Instructions here: https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud/docs-ble/encryption/

Use to easily factory reset shelly device, to remove encryption mode easily for example.
I did this when I was in a case where the android app stop showing me the encrypt/decrypt menu after I delete and re-add the same Shelly sensor.

```
$ cargo run
```
